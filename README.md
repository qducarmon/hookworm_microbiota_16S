# Hookworm infection and gut microbiota

This study profiled the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of 20 volunteers who were voluntarily infected with Necator americanus larvae and followed over time at five time points.

## Requirements
- R version 3.6.1 ("Action of the Toes")
- All packages and dependencies loaded in the different markdown scripts

## Worfklow
- Start by loading the phyloseq objects in the "Data_preparation_cleaning.Rmd"
- In principle, now all other markdown files are standalone, apart from specific figures
- Some multipanel figures (Figure 3 and 4) require figures from other markdown files, so if these multipanel figures are not generated, please have a look at that
- The names of the markdown files indicate which analyses are performed in that specific markdown, so that should be okay.
